FINAL PROJECT 

COVID vaccination rates vary a great deal between countries. There are several reasons, including economics (richer countries tend to have higher rates) and demographics (countries prioritize recipients by age). The goal of this project is to use linear regression to model the vaccination rates in different countries in terms of their GDP (a measure of economic output) and demographics.
